# Kite

A simple news aggregator application using Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Flutter Version Management (FVM)](https://fvm.app/) to manage
SDK versions.

Can be installed via `brew`:

```sh
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm
```

Once installed, run:

```sh
fvm install
```

This will install the Flutter version defined in the project.

To run Flutter commands:

```sh
# Use
fvm flutter <command>
# Instead of
flutter <command>
```

Recommended to alias this in `.bashrc` or equivalent.
